# Python-GUI-Interactive-Plotter
A gui for rapid plotting of csv files, either processed or taken straight from the osilloscope. Some basic processing and manipulation is possible after the data is loaded. Can load in multiple files for comparison. Uses matplotlib and wxpython. Essentially, it's quicker than excel for a quick-look at data files, where there are typically ~100k points to plot.
